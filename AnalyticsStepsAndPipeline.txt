Analytics/Visualization pipeline:

S3.1 - all data with sentiment features.
??? Glue for duplicate and redundant column removal 
Athena Views for specified brand/item
QuickSight queries through Athena


Steps for Analytics/Visualization 
S3:
Create a bucket to hold all the data with sentiment features as a list of parquet files
Create a bucket to hold Athena query results stored as csv + metadata. 
Athena:
Set the primary (or other) workgroup output to proper S3 bucket
Create the main data table (and database if necessary) through SQL
Create specified views
QuickSight:
Load datasets from views
Create dashboards

Notes:
Lifecycle rules can limit how long the data query exists until it is deleted.
Anytime QuickSight filters data, that is considered a query. Those queries can probably be systematically stored and kept for additional analysis for trends over time. We can potentially  store them and mention this idea in the final report/presentation.

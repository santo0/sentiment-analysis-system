Analytics/Visualization pipeline:

S3 per customer - contains processed data in folders per product/feature
??? Glue for duplicate and redundant column removal 
Athena Views for loading hdfs files into quicksight
QuickSight queries through Athena


Steps for Analytics/Visualization 
S3:
Have list of buckets for processed customer tweets
Create a single bucket to hold Athena query results stored as csv + metadata. 
Athena:
Set the primary (or other) workgroup output to proper S3 bucket (the one we created)
Create the main data table (and database if necessary) through SQL
QuickSight:
Create dataset from the corresponding table (select to use SPICE)
Create dashboards

Notes:
Lifecycle rules can limit how long the data query exists until it is deleted.
Anytime QuickSight filters data, that is considered a query. Those queries can probably be systematically stored and kept for additional analysis for trends over time. We can potentially  store them and mention this idea in the final report/presentation.
